## Rationale

Video games have quickly grown to be the highest grossing form of media
entertainment. However, most core titles are designed not for a general
audience, but for gamers who have been playing video games for many years,
and are familiar with the language of video games<sup>[[1](#ref-1)]</sup>.

Worse still, the majority of games that are designed for a casual audience in
mind rely on predatory methods of monetization that end up siphoning hundreds,
if not thousands<sup>[[2](#ref-2)]</sup>, of dollars from unsuspecting
players. These games employ deceptive methods of design intended to
take fun away from players who don't continue to pay up, such as timed
waiting<sup>[[3](#ref-3)]</sup> or even "loot boxes" that contain random
in-game power-ups, purchased with real-world money<sup>[[4](#ref-4)]</sup>.

This list is intended to be a collection of games that do not employ predatory
monetization techniques while also still being suitable for beginners.

## Games For Absolute Beginners

### Dragon Quest

Dragon Quest is a game where you, the last descendent of an old hero named
Erdrick, must defeat the Dragonlord of Castle Charlock, who threatens to
destroy the whole world of Alefgard. To stop him, you will explore a wide
world, fight off ambushes from monsters, improve your character's abilities,
and discover interesting - and deadly - locales. All of the tropes are
present: fight off a dragon, rescue the princess, explore an ancient tomb,
collect magical MacGuffins. What makes Dragon Quest special is that it
not only leans heavily into these tropes, but also provides an engaging,
worthwhile experience that is easy for non-gamers to get started with.

Dragon Quest is on our list because of its pure simplicity. Its story is
straightforward. Its world is large enough for you to often find interesting
new places, but not so large that you always get lost. Battle mechanics have
only a small amount of variables at play at any given time. Beyond that,
there are three larger reasons for this game's inclusion on this list.

First, the game's controls are easy to understand and allow you time to
make your choices. There are no scenarios where a player must rush to make
a decision. For instance, if you find yourself in a dark cave, resources
dwindling, face-to-face with a powerful creature, you can take your time to
decide whether to attack, use a spell, or run. Even the most stressful of
gameplay situations give you room to breathe.

Second, the game is not overly punishing of failure. If your character dies in
battle, you are simply transported back to the game's first castle, keeping
all treasure you've earned and character levels you've attained. The only
consequence is the loss of some gold pieces, which you can easily earn back.

Third, Dragon Quest can be purchased in full for less than $5 US.

Dragon Quest is available on the following platforms:

- iOS ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dragon-quest/id911201894))
- Android ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.dq1_gp))
- Nintendo Switch ([Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dragon-quest-switch/))

Much of the same can be said of Dragon Quests' sequels, though each of them
are larger and they all introduce new mechanics to the battling system. Dragon
Quest II introduces multiple heroes in one party at any given time, and Dragon
Quest III allows you to create your own fully-customized party of adventurers.

### Minecraft

Minecraft - the magnum opus of Sweden's own Mojang, now a flagship game for
Microsoft. Many have described it as a "children's game" however it is anything
but. Minecraft provides the player with an infinitely unique experience every
time, and is highly adaptable to many different play styles. Novice gamers can
set their difficulty to Peaceful, and wander around a vast, friendly world
devoid of monsters. Veteran players can create a new Hardcore world and battle
the elements - and a large variety of enemies - to work towards their final
goal. If you want your gameplay experience to be anywhere between, that's your
prerogative.

When players create a new world, the game coaches you through the basics in a
very non-intrusive way. Movement, inventory access, and resource gathering are
all introduced to the player in a way that doesn't take away from the wonder of
the game. Furthermore, with the introduction of the Recipe Book from the World
of Color update, the player is never left confused as to how to craft the game's
over 350 different items.

Minecraft's most impressive feature, however, is the number of possible
different worlds that can be created. World generation is based on a randomly
generated number. This results in a possible 2<sup>64</sup> possible worlds
(that's over eighteen quintillion different worlds!), which means the player's
experience will be different every time.

There are two versions of Minecraft you can buy - Java Edition and Bedrock
Edition. Java Edition is exclusive to PCs, running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Bedrock Edition is available for Windows, Android, iOS, Xbox One, PlayStation 4,
and Nintendo Switch - and cross-platform play is possible between all of them!
Cross-platform means that a player on an Xbox, and a player on a Playstation can
play together, meaning you can enjoy Minecraft with friends no matter what
console they play on!

With Minecraft, there's enough to explore to last a lifetime, and anybody - from
the youngest child to the oldest grandparent - can have an enjoyable experience
that'll never be the same thing twice.

### Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga

Originally released for the Game Boy Advance, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga expands on the turn-based RPG mario games introduced
in the 1996 SNES game Super Mario RPG. Superstar Saga was so well-recieved by Nintendo fans that they remastered it for the 3DS. Tasked with reclaiming Princess Peach's voice from the Beanbean Kingdom, an all-new location to explore. Featuring both fan-favourites and never-before-seen characters, Superstar Saga is a game that will capture your attention for hours.

The 3DS remaster of Superstar Saga features a new game - Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser (Bowser's Minions), where you take control of Captain Goomba and guide him though the Beanbean Kingdom to recover Bowser. The story runs concurrently to the Superstar Saga story, and allows the player to explore what happened to Bowser while Mario and Luigi were searching for Peach's voice.

Superstar Saga is available on the Nintendo eShop, with remastered version appearing on the 3DS, and the Game Boy Advance Virtual Console port appearing on the Wii U:

- 3DS ([Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-luigi-superstar-saga-bowsers-minions-3ds/))
- Wii U ([Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-luigi-superstar-saga-wii-u/))
