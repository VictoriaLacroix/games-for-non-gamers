## Rationale

Video games have quickly grown to be the highest grossing form of media
entertainment. However, most core titles are designed not for a general
audience, but for gamers who have been playing video games for many years, and
are familiar with the language of video games [[1]](#ref-1).

Worse still, the majority of games that are designed for a casual audience in
mind rely on predatory methods of monetization that end up siphoning hundreds,
if not thousands [[2]](#ref-2), of dollars from unsuspecting players. These games
employ deceptive methods of design intended to take fun away from players who
don't continue to pay up, such as timed waiting [[3]](#ref-3) or even "loot boxes"
that contain random in-game power-ups, purchased with real-world
money [[4]](#ref-4).

This list is intended to be a collection of games that do not employ predatory
monetization techniques while also still being suitable for beginners.

## Games For Absolute Beginners

NOTE: This section will soon be amended with more recommendations.

### Dragon Quest

Dragon Quest is a game where you, the last descendent of an old hero named
Erdrick, must defeat the Dragonlord of Castle Charlock, who threatens to destroy
the whole world of Alefgard.

Dragon Quest is on our list because of its pure simplicity. The game's story is
straightforward. The world is large enough for you to often discover interesting
locales, but not so large that you always get lost. Battle mechanics have only a
small amount of variables at play at any given time.

Most importantly however, is that the game's controls are easy to understand and
allow you time to make your choices. There are no scenarios where a player must
rush to make a choice. For instance, if you find yourself in a dark cave,
resources dwindling, face-to-face with a powerful creature, you can take your
time to decide whether to attack, use a spell, or run.

Most importantly, the game is not overly punishing of failure. If your character
dies in battle, you are simply transported back to the game's first castle,
keeping all treasure you've earned and character levels you've attained. The
only consequence is the loss of some money, which can easily be earned back.

Dragon Quest is available on the following platforms:

- iOS ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dragon-quest/id911201894))
- Android ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.dq1_gp))
- Nintendo Switch ([Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dragon-quest-switch/))

Much of the same can be said of Dragon Quests' sequels, though each of them are
quite larger and they all introduce new mechanics to the battling system. Dragon
Quest II introduces multiple heros in one party at any given time, and Dragon
Quest III allows you to create your own band of adventurers.
